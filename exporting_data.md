FRC Krawler exports all data to a *.csv* file. This file can be opened in most programs like tableau, excel, and can be imported into google docs for easy sharing. You can also keep these files on the device and connect it up to a computer. Exports are available under the Android file explorer. FRC Krawler has two types of exports; raw and summary. Summaries are averaged data for each team at a particular event. This is good if you want to get quick data or see how they did overall during the competition. Raw exports are at a lower level. Unlike summaries, raw exports give you a match-by-match view of how a team did at a competition.
